    "bio": "Hey there! I'm Milo (they/them). Currently, I am the Creative Media Traffic Manager on the Marketing Team at Airbnb. For 15 years I have specialized in media archiving and digital asset management for photography, video, interactives, and animation in cultural heritage and higher education. Prior to that, I was the Media Asset Manager at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the Lead Technical Analyst for Digital Asset Management at The Metropolitan Museum of Art for five years. I've also held positions in digital asset management at the American Museum of Natural History and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I really enjoy knowledge sharing and sometimes I guest lecture at Pratt Institute, New York University, and the Metropolitan New York Library Council.",
